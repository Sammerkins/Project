				This book has its origins in the author, Lorraine Hansberry's
				childhood. At a young age, she and her family moved into a
				previously all-white neighborhood. This right, won in a supreme
				court case, was met with massive resistance. All this translated
				into the play which takes place in the 1950s a decade before the
				civil rights movement took off. One source described it saying,
				“Beneath the economic prosperity that characterized America in
				the years following World War II roiled growing domestic and
				racial tension”(6). Another source described the decade as
				having made clear, “the gap between the American dream and the
				black Americans” (Domina). Both of these descriptions are made
				evident in this play. This charming tale shows the Younger
				Family, with each person trying to achieve their American dream.

				<li>
					Mama - Her dream is to give her children a better life than
					she had. This shows through her giving Walter the money he
					needs to follow his dream and paying for Benetha’s school.
					Her second dream is one she has held onto for many years:
					having a house with a garden she can tend and a yard for her
					grandson, Travis, to play in.
				</li>
				<li>
					Walter - His dream is to be wealthy enough to provide for
					his wife and son. His second dream is to make sure that
					Travis, his son, can reach his goals and dreams easier than
					he has been able to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ruth - Her dream is to have a happy family and for her son
					and husband's dreams to come true. The house becomes a dream
					for her because she believes that it will help her family be
					happy.

				<li>
					Beneatha - Her dream is to be able to help people. This
					shows through her wanting to be a doctor and learning all
					she can. Her second dream is to be free of what is expected
