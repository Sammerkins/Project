			<p class="box" id="PContext">
				Before America was formed as a nation, the Pilgrims looked to
				the hope of a better future and traveled to the new world. They
				“lived as people who imagined a destiny for themselves”
				(Cullen). This means they paved the way for the American dream
				to be a possibility by laying down the groundwork. Leaving
				England to be able to worship God in their fashion, they
				followed this dream to Holland. Then after living there for some
				time, they left Holland and sought a new world. They wanted to
				create a better future for their children, enabling them to
				pursue life, liberty, and happiness in their fashion. This was
				over a century before those words were used to inspire a
				revolution following that same dream. They landed in December of
				1620 where they began to establish their colony.
			</p>

			<h1 class="box" id="DREAMS">Their Dream</h1>
			<p class="box">
				The Pilgrims' “American dream” was to give their children a
				better future. To them, this meant risking everything so their
				children could grow up being able to worship God.
			</p>

			<h1 class="box" id="SUM">Conclusion</h1>
			<p class="box" id="PSum">
				In conclusion, the Pilgrims began the American dream. As
				Governor Roger Wilcott said in Of Plymouth Plantation, “For here
				not alone did godly men and women suffer greatly for a great
				cause but their noble purpose was not doomed to defeat but was
				carried to perfect victory. They [e]stablished what they
				planned. Their feeble plantation became the birthplace of
				religious liberty, the cradle of a free commonwealth. to them a
				mighty nation owns its debt” (8). We owe them a great deal for
				starting this dream on which the nation was built.
